Once there was a student who attended CSSI.
In the first week she learned Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
She figured out how to use w3schools.com and StackOverflow, which really helped her with CSS.
Javascript is nice, but Python is much better.

However, she would soon learn that things that seem hard at first get easier
with more practice.
