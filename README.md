Once there was a student who attended CSSI.
In the first week she learned Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
She thinks she'll get the hang of CSS after some more practice.
And Javascript is ok.
Python is much better.

However, she would soon learn that things that seem hard at first get easier with more practice.
